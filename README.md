gem2

This is a simple library that processes a json response from an API, having received data from a hypothetical get request that included zip, income, and age information.  

It was created using Rspec domain specific language testing tool and uses the net::http ruby protocol for testing the get request on localhost using the sample json provided in the example.  It was developed on Ruby 2.3.0.

Previous attempts to learn other unit testing software failed in the time allotted.
